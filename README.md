## Problem statement 

### Build a calculator package that has separate module for:

* sin, cos, tan, tanh, SoftMax, Sigmoid, ReLU, log and e

* The modules shall include their derivatives as well

* If we do import calculator, we should be able to access all the above function (except deviratives)

* For derivates we must do: from package import derivatives. 

* Outputs are returned as well as printed using only f-string

* Write simple test cases to check the outputs of each operator and their derivative
